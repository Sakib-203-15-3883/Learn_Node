# Learn_NodeJS

 #Event_driven_architecture:

Node.js is built on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows for efficient handling of concurrent requests.

 #Asynchronous programming: 

Node.js promotes asynchronous programming using callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax to handle I/O operations without blocking the execution of other tasks.

 #Modules:

Node.js follows the CommonJS module system, allowing you to break your code into reusable modules and use require() to import modules.

# Build in modules:

HTTP and Networking: Node.js has a built-in http module that allows you to create HTTP servers and clients for building web applications or interacting with other web services.

File System Operations: The fs module in Node.js provides functionality for interacting with the file system, including reading and writing files, creating directories, rename file , appending file , checking file, deleting file  and more.
  
# local modules

# third party modules

 #NPM (Node Package Manager):

NPM is the default package manager for Node.js, providing access to a vast ecosystem of open-source packages and libraries.

 #Error handling:

Proper error handling is crucial in Node.js applications. It involves handling both synchronous and asynchronous errors, and using try/catch blocks or error-first callbacks.

 #Promises and async/await:

Promises and async/await are modern JavaScript features used for handling asynchronous operations in a more readable and synchronous-like manner.

 #Deployment and Hosting:

Node.js applications can be deployed to various platforms, including cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure), containerization platforms (e.g., Docker), or traditional servers.
